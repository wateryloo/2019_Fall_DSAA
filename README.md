# 2019_Fall_DSAA
This is my repo for some code for lab in DSAA course in 2019 fall semester in SUSTech. If you want to use anything in it, here are the few things you should know.

- There is **no warranty** for my code.
- You must not use this repo to cheat in exams or homework.
- You have to make sure that you follow everything listed in **Regulations on Academic Misconduct in Assignments for Undergraduate Students in the SUSTech Department of Computer Science and Engineering.pdf**.
- When you use or redistribute my code, you should **make credits**.

I will not upload the code until the lab is **overdue**. If you find this repo inappropriate (with a reason), contact me.

It is possible that I use some code from other sources. I will try my best to make credits. If you find something that I accidentally missed, please do **contact me**. I will be very willing to make corrections.
