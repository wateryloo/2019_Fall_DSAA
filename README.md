# 2019_Fall_DSAA
This is my repo for some code for lab in DSAA course in 2019 fall semester in SUSTech.

This repo is mainly **for fun** and for **recording** what I did or experienced in university.

This repo also serves **ducational purpose**. If you want to learn something (very possibly you will not), or you want to help me to learn, I will be happy to see that.

This repo is **non-profit**, and **NOT** for any kind of **academic misconduct**. You should **NOT** use this repo to make money or for any academic misconduct.

If everything is correct, I will not upload the code until the lab is **overdue**. If you find or think that I upload the code too early, please do **contact me** here and I will make corrections.

There is **no warranty** for my code.

You can read, modify, use and redistribute the code I upload, but you have to follow **academic rules**. When you use or redistribute my code, you should **make credits**. If you modified, or improved the code, I am more than happy to add you to the contributors list.

To be noticed, your behavior must **NOT** violate anything mentioned in thie file, **Regulations on Academic Misconduct in Assignments for Undergraduate Students in the SUSTech Department of Computer Science and Engineering.pdf**.

It is possible that I use some code from other sources. I will try my best to make credits. If you find something that I accidentally missed, please do **contact me** here or through email. I will be very willing to make corrections.

If you are someone concerned and you think that this repo is inappropriate, please do **contact me** here or through email. I will be very willing to make corrections.
